# Data Management Policy

C3LX has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored in conjunction with C3LX Apps and Tools. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by C3LX.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of C3LX. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for C3LX and C3LX Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when it needed and in case of disaster. Aptible manages data backups on behalf of C3LX.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

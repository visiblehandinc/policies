# Data Management Policy

VisibleHand has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored in conjunction with VisibleHand Apps and Tools. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by VisibleHand.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of VisibleHand. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for VisibleHand and VisibleHand Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when it needed and in case of disaster. Aptible manages data backups on behalf of VisibleHand.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Policies to Assure 3rd Parties Support C3LX Compliance

1. The following steps are required before 3rd parties are granted access to any C3LX systems:
    - Due diligence with the 3rd party;
    - Controls implemented to maintain compliance;
    - Written agreements, with appropriate security requirements, are executed.
2. All connections and data in transit between the C3LX Platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. Access granted to external parties is limited to the minimum necessary and granted only for the duration required.
4. A standard business associate agreement with Clients and Partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organization’s security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
5. C3LX has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with Subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
    - C3LX utilizes monitoring tools to regularly evaluate Subcontractors against relevant SLAs.
6. Third parties are unable to make changes to any C3LX infrastructure without explicit permission from C3LX. Additionally, no C3LX Customers or Partners have access outside of their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete anything related to other 3rd parties.
7. Whenever outsourced development is utilized by C3LX, all changes to production systems will be approved and implemented by C3LX workforce members only. All outsourced development requires a formal contract with C3LX.
8. C3LX maintains and annually reviews a list all current Partners and Subcontractors.
9. C3LX assesses security requirements and compliance considerations with all Partners and Subcontracts.
    - C3LX leverages recurring calendar invites to assure reviews of SLAs with all 3rd parties are performed annually. These are performed by the C3LX Security Officer and Privacy Officer. Google Forms are used to track such reviews.
11. Regular review is conducted as required by SLAs to assure security and compliance. These reviews include reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures and disruptions, and identified issues are investigated and resolved in a reasonable and timely manner. 
12. Any changes to Partner and Subcontractor services and systems are reviewed before implementation.
13. For all partners, C3LX reviews activity annually to assure partners are in line with SLAs in contracts with C3LX.

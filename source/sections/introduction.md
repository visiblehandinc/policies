# Introduction

VisibleHand, Inc (“VisibleHand") is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Users and Clients (“Customers”).

VisibleHand provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted software falls into two broad categories: 1) **Health and Wellness Applications (Apps)** and 2) **Population Health Management & Reporting (Tools)**. These Categories are cited throughout polices as Customers in each category inherit different policies, procedures, and obligations from VisibleHand.

As providers of disease-specific, patient-facing health and wellness software, VisibleHand strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by VisibleHand to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and transmit ePHI for VisibleHand Customers.

## License

VisibleHand HIPAA policies have been adapted from the Catalyze, Inc. open-source HIPAA policies.

## Health and Wellness Applications (Apps)

Apps Customers utilize hosted software from VisibleHand to input and store personal health data. Customers also communicate with VisibleHand employed health coaches (“Coaches”) within the software. These apps are deployed into compliant containers run on systems secured and managed by Aptible, Inc (“Aptible”). Aptible does not have insight or access into application level data of Apps Customers and, as such, does not have the ability to secure or manage risk associated with application level vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. With Apps, VisibleHand has access to data models and manages all application level configurations and security. VisibleHand makes every effort to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure, access, and/or breach of Apps Customer data through network (firewalls, dedicated IP spaces, etc) and server settings (encryption at rest and in transit, Threatstack throughout the Platform, etc).

## Population Health Management & Reporting (Tools)

Tools are compliant services that are offered as part of the Apps. These services currently include our Health Coach Platform (Patient Monitoring and secure Messaging Service) and Friends & Family Platform (Single Patient Monitoring). With Tools, VisibleHand has access to data models and manages all application level configurations and security.

In the future there may be 3rd party Add-on services available as part of the VisibleHand Apps and Tools (“Platform”). These 3rd party, or Partner, Services will be fully reviewed by VisibleHand to assure they do not have a negative impact on VisibleHand's information security and compliance posture.

## Compliance Inheritance
VisibleHand signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its 3rd party providers (“Providers”). These BAAs outline VisibleHand's obligations and Provider obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing infrastructure and managing security configurations that are a part of the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as future compliance frameworks, VisibleHand does not manage any aspects of compliance for Providers.

Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, VisibleHand Providers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of VisibleHand.

# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, VisibleHand understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as  a business associate, VisibleHand is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, VisibleHand has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for VisibleHand Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current VisibleHand Customers have data stored by VisibleHand as a part of the VisibleHand Platform.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
    1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
    2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from VisibleHand and/or to have VisibleHand continue to store the data at a rate of $1/month for up to 1GB. If there is more than 1GB of data, VisibleHand will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
    3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from VisibleHand within 30 days, VisibleHand removes data from VisibleHand systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.

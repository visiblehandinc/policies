# Vulnerability Scanning Policy

C3LX is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. C3LX utilizes Threatstack to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize Threatstack on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* Threatstack management is performed by the C3LX Security Officer with assistance from the Engineering Lead.
* Threatstack is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on C3LX networks.
* Frequency of scanning is as follows:
    1. on a weekly basis;
    2. after every production deployment.
* Reviewing Threatstack reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the C3LX Security Officer.
* In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
    1. All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
    2. Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, Engineering Lead, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by C3LX.
        * Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
        * Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the C3LX Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by C3LX.
* Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the C3LX vulnerability management policy.
    * External penetration testing is performed annually by a third party.
    * Internal penetration testing is bi-annually.
    * Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the C3LX Security Officer.
    * Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by C3LX.
* This vulnerability policy is reviewed on an annual basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
